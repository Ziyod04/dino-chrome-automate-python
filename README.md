ATTENTION!
This code depends on your screen resolution. So it works in my screen very well, but if your resolution is different , you should change resolution in code.

Use the package manager [pip3](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install foobar.

```bash
 pip3 install pyautogui
Â pip3 install pillow
```
